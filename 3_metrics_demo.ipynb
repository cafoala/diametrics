    "Hypo- and hyper-glycemic events are defined as 15 minutes or more below and above the relevant thresholds respectively.\n",
    "                        \n",
    "Since this metric is dependent on the progression of time, it is affected more greatly by missing data and discrepancies in recording interval. It also doesn’t help that the international consensus is incredibly vague about this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the hypoglycemic events were calculated is as follows, the same will be the case with hyperglycemic events, but just working above the thresholds rather than below.\n",
    "* Identify all times the glucose dips below 3.9mmol/L for at least 15 mins (2 readings for FreeStyle Libre, 4 for Dexcom and Medtronic)\n",
    "* If there is another dip below the threshold within the next 15 mins of the glucose coming back up then it is part of the same event\n",
    "* If 15 consecutive minutes of readings go below the level 2 hypoglycemia threshold (3.0mmol/L) then it is considered to be a level 2 event. If not, it’s just a level 1 event.\n",
    "* Only when the glucose rises above the threshold for 15 mins is the event over\n",
    "* The start time and end time of each episode are used to calculate the total time spent in hypoglycemia and the average length of event\n",
    "\n",
    "Things get a bit more complicated if there’s missing data. These are the assumptions that have been made in order to calculate the events and may result in very high time spent in events and average glucose readings.\n",
    "* If the glucose readings drop out during an event, if the first glucose reading after the drop out is also in hypoglycemia, this is considered to be part of the same episode. This is where you could end up with very long episodes if there’s a lot of missing data and it cuts out and cuts in in hypoglycemia. \n",
    "* However, if the first glucose reading is not below the hypoglycemia threshold, the episode is considered to have ended with the last glucose reading\n",
    "* If there are, for example, 10 mins of readings in hypoglycemia and then the readings cut out for 15 mins, then come back in with 10 mins of hypoglycemia, this is not considered an episode because there aren’t 15 mins of consistent readings                        \n",
